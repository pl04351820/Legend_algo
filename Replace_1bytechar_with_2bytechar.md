# Replace 1 bytechar with 2bytechar in array method.
- Brute force 
    Iterate the array, then use insert method. 
    Time: O(nlog(n))    Space:O(1)

- Count first, then restrute from end point.
    Iterate the array, then count how many 1bytechar needs to be replaced.
    Calculate the space costs and use two points to reconstrut the array.
    Time: O(n)  Space: O(1)

# Extend --> reverse construt 
Combine two arraies.
